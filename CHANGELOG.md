# Change Log

## 0.3.3

### Bug Fixes

- **Textarea Height on Resize** — Reset textarea inline height when the input area is manually resized via drag handle, so the textarea fills the new container height instead of staying at its auto-grown height

- **Workspace Thread Filtering** — Filter threads by current workspace on initialization, preventing the GUI from loading the most recent thread from a different project when creating a new session

- **Thread Update Field Preservation** — Merge partial API responses with existing thread data instead of overwriting, fixing a bug where `/mode agent` would silently revert to the config default after sending a message

### Improvements

- **Work Panel Animation Simplification** — Remove interactive-style animations (shimmer, pulse, hover translate) from read-only checklist and strategy items to match the static display style of session/thread lists

## 0.3.2

### Bug Fixes

- **Apply Patch Diff Preview** — Support diff preview for apply_patch tool outputs from input patch/changes

- **Session Reset State Cleanup** — Clear stale sidebar work and changes state when resetting the webview session, so old session data does not persist into new sessions

- **Accurate Diff Line Numbers** — Separate single-diff and cumulative-diff modes: per-card diffs in reasoning sessions now show full files with correct line numbers instead of only hunk fragments

- **Diff View Line Alignment** — Align diff view line numbers with actual file positions by reverse-applying diff hunks to current file content, making it easier to correlate hunks with their real positions

## 0.3.1

### New Features

- **Thread List Visibility Setting** — Add a config option to control whether the Threads tab is shown in the sidebar (hidden by default since Sessions are the user-facing conversation list)

- **Settings Dropdowns and Panel Polish** — Clickable dropdown menus for mode, model, and reasoning effort in the settings bar; refactored work and changes panels with CSS classes; added icons to empty-state messages; improved task card styling

- **Resizable Panels and Unified Send/Stop Button** — Drag handles for sidebar width and input area height resizing; unified send/stop button that toggles based on streaming state; improved input area layout

## 0.3.0

### New Features

- **Agent Runs Sidebar** — Added an Agent Runs panel with delegate cards so background agent activity and delegated work are easier to inspect from the GUI.

- **Session Search And Delete** — The sidebar now supports searching saved sessions and removing sessions you no longer need.

### Improvements

- **Streaming Status Animation** — Replaced the old blinking cursor with pulse and bounce dot animations for a clearer streaming-state indicator.

### Bug Fixes

- **Tool Call Terminal Events** — Fixed tool call terminal event handling to prevent GUI freezes while TUI commands are running.

- **Approval Freeze And Session Duplication** — Resolved approval-flow freezes and stopped concurrent turns from creating duplicate sessions.

- **Multi-Turn Event Isolation** — Prevented stale turn events from corrupting later multi-turn conversations.

- **Changes Panel Consistency** — Fixed repeated edits to the same file so every modification appears in the Changes panel instead of only the first one.

## 0.2.0

### New Features

- **Independent Changes Panel** — Added a dedicated Changes sidebar panel so file modifications are easier to inspect during a conversation, while also reducing duplicate change entries.

- **Per-Turn Session Auto-Save** — The GUI now saves the current session after each completed turn, improving recovery and continuation across restarts.

### Improvements

- **Session Recovery Performance** — Optimized session recovery to make better use of cached state and reduce unnecessary reload work.

- **Frontend Architecture Cleanup** — Reorganized the source tree into feature-focused modules, split the webview HTML/CSS/JS into smaller units, and centralized session state and engine/API synchronization for easier maintenance.

- **History Rendering And Test Coverage** — Improved chat history rendering and expanded the automated test suite around the refactored GUI flows.

### Bug Fixes

- **Changes Panel Sync** — File changes produced by tool calls now stay in sync with the Changes panel instead of being missed or shown inconsistently.

## 0.1.2

### New Features

- **Sessions Sidebar** — Browse and resume saved sessions from the sidebar. A new "Sessions" tab sits alongside the legacy "Threads" tab, with a workspace filter toggle to show sessions from all workspaces or just the current one.

- **File Attachments** — The `/attach` command now opens a native file picker. Attach images, videos, PDFs, or any file to your message. Attachments are embedded directly into the conversation text.

- **Cross-Workspace Thread Resumption** — Loading a thread from a different workspace now automatically updates its workspace to the current one, preventing stalled conversations and misdirected output.

- **Auto-Save Threads as Sessions** — Completed conversations are automatically saved as sessions, making them available for cross-workspace resumption. Deduplication ensures each thread is saved only once.

- **Session Loading Error Handling** — Friendly error messages when a session is not found (404) or the server encounters an error, with automatic session list refresh on failure.

- **Skills Slash Command** — Added `/skills` command to list and manage available skills.

- **Runtime API Capability Detection** — GUI now probes the running TUI backend at startup to discover available API endpoints (undo, retry, snapshot restore). Features depending on unmerged upstream PRs are automatically disabled rather than failing at runtime.

- **TUI Version Display** — The status bar now shows the connected TUI backend version, helping users and maintainers understand the runtime environment at a glance.

- **Improved Unavailable-Feature UX** — Undo, Retry, and Revert buttons now show a distinct "unavailable" visual style (dashed border, muted colors) with a reliable custom tooltip explaining why the feature is not available, replacing unreliable native `title` behavior.

### Improvements

- **Trust Mode Consistency** — Yolo mode now correctly sets both `trust_mode` and `auto_approve` flags. `/trust off` preserves these flags only when in yolo mode.

- **Session Save Compatibility** — `saveThreadAsSession()` now falls back to the mainline `POST /v1/sessions` endpoint when the `/v1/sessions/save-current` route is unavailable, preventing save failures on stock TUI builds.

- **i18n** — Added Chinese and English translations for sessions, workspace filter, file attachment labels, and unavailable-feature tooltips.
